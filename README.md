# Semi-Structured Interview Data: Catholic Perspectives on Sacred Art and AI

## Overview

This dataset contains responses from seven semi-structured interviews conducted as part of ethnographic research investigating how contemporary Catholics negotiate the sacredness of religious images generated by artificial intelligence. The interviews were conducted with Catholics in Brazil, selected through Catholic WhatsApp groups using a snowball sampling method.

The research employed a circular methodology where initial survey data (n=25) informed interview questions, and interview findings guided subsequent netnographic fieldwork return to online Catholic forums and visual social media platforms.

## Interview Structure

Five core questions were designed to elicit extended responses and reveal underlying categorization patterns:

**Question 1 (Q1):** "What is art?"
- Analysis categories: (a) objective/universal definition; (b) subjective/personal definition

**Question 2 (Q2):** "What makes art sacred?"
- Analysis categories: (a) response based on Catechism of the Catholic Church (CIC); (b) personal doxa/hermeneutics; (c) parallel or complementary teaching to Catholic doctrine

**Question 3 (Q3):** "What makes art beautiful?"
- Analysis categories: (a) technical/objective/universal response; (b) subjective/personal response

**Question 4 (Q4):** "Do you use technology as an aid in Catholic religious practices (prayers, novenas, daily readings, learning, liturgical participation)?"
- Response options: Yes/No

**Question 5 (Q5):** "Have you used artificial intelligence to assist with any devotional practice or study about the Catholic faith?"
- Response options: Yes/No

## Analytical Approach

The research employed pragmatic discourse analysis to identify both explicit and implicit terms in responses. When respondents had difficulty providing direct definitions, the researcher extracted characteristics through follow-up questions and identified conceptual patterns.

Key analytical distinctions:
- **Objectification**: Use of universalizable categories without modalization
- **Subjectivation**: Presence of perspective markers ("in my opinion," "for me," "I think")

These distinctions refer to epistemic practices—how interviewees position statements—not ontological judgments about reality.

## Key Findings

### Response Pattern Distribution

**Q1 (What is art?):**
- Objective/universal definitions: 5 respondents
- Subjective/personal definitions: 2 respondents

**Q2 (What makes art sacred?):**
- Based on Catholic doctrine (CIC): 4 respondents
- Personal hermeneutics: 2 respondents
- Parallel/complementary teaching: 1 respondent

**Q3 (What makes art beautiful?):**
- Technical/objective/universal: 4 respondents
- Subjective/personal: 3 respondents

**Q4 (Technology use in religious practices):**
- Yes: 4 respondents
- No: 3 respondents

**Q5 (AI use for devotional purposes):**
- Yes: 1 respondent
- No: 6 respondents

### Notable Observations

1. **Fragmented Definitions**: Most respondents defined art by qualities (beauty, perfection, order) rather than providing conceptual essences, revealing abductive rather than definitional thinking patterns.

2. **Doctrine-Practice Tension**: Even respondents with theological knowledge showed difficulty dissociating "technical perfection" from "devotional adequacy."

3. **Limited AI Adoption**: Only one respondent (Leonardo José) reported using AI for devotional purposes (confession preparation), indicating significant resistance to algorithmic mediation of sacred practices.

4. **Multiple Cosmologies**: Respondents employed various rationalities simultaneously, including demonological perspectives (AI as potential preternatural vector), anthropocentric views (AI as neutral tool), and aesthetic criteria (AI images failing to meet art standards).

## Theoretical Framework

The analysis draws on:
- **Actor-Network Theory** (Latour, 2005): Understanding how multiple agencies interact
- **Art and Agency** (Gell, 1998): Abductive chains that allow recognition of divine agency
- **Image and Pilgrimage** (Turner & Turner, 1978): Distinction between exegetical and operational meaning
- **Symbolic Imagination** (Durand, 1993): Function of religious symbols

## Semiotic Analysis Subset

Three respondents who demonstrated greater clarity in defining art underwent additional semiotic analysis examining their responses to AI-generated sacred images.

Images presented:
1. Sacred Heart of Jesus (ChatGPT-generated)
2. Our Lady of Fatima (ArtGuru-generated) 
3. Holy Trinity in Byzantine style (Freepik-generated)

## Methodological Notes

**"Between-Worlds" Approach**: Following Orsi (2005), the research distinguished different "universes" Catholics inhabit, avoiding homogenization of "Catholic positions."

**Circular Methodology**: Field returns after initial data collection allowed refinement of questions and discovery of new analytical dimensions.

**Response Reduction**: Original lengthy responses were reduced to conceptual maps preserving hierarchical relationships and core terms.

## Data Use Guidelines

This data represents:
- Personal theological perspectives, not official Church doctrine
- Snapshot of Brazilian Catholic attitudes in 2024-2025
- Urban, educated, digitally-connected Catholic demographic
- Primarily young adults engaged in Catholic university communities

Researchers using this data should consider:
- Cultural specificity of Brazilian Catholicism
- Generational factors in technology adoption
- Self-selection bias (participants from active Catholic communities)
- Translation effects (original interviews conducted in Portuguese)
