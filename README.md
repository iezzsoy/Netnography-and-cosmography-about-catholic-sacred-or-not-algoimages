# Catholic Sacred Art and AI: Research Repository

## Overview

This repository contains empirical materials, methodological documentation, and analytical artifacts from qualitative research investigating how contemporary Catholics negotiate the sacredness of religious images, particularly those generated by artificial intelligence systems. The research explores symbolic, aesthetic, and doctrinal dimensions of sacred art reception within Catholic communities.

## Repository Structure

### Core Documentation

**`methods_used.md`**
Comprehensive methodological framework detailing all research approaches employed:
- Netnography (virtual ethnography)
- Documentary analysis of forum threads and texts
- Comparative analysis using "between-worlds" method
- Semi-structured interviews (n=7)
- Survey methodology (n=25)
- Visual semiotic analysis
- Circular observer method with iterative field returns

**`methodology_flowchart.md`**
Visual representation of the research process showing the iterative flow between virtual ethnographic pilgrimage, data collection, interviews, image analysis, and field returns.

**`actors.md`**
Actor-Network Theory mapping of all entities involved in sacred image production and reception:
- Human actors: Catholic believers, artists, developers
- Divine entities: God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, Saints
- Technological actors: Devices, AI models, platforms, databases
- Material actors: Sacred art, digital images, traditional norms
- Includes class diagram showing relationships and hierarchies

**`flow_actors.md`**
Flowchart diagram illustrating interactions and influences between all actors in the network, showing how divine inspiration, human creation, technological mediation, and traditional norms intersect in contemporary sacred image production.

### Data Files

**`survey_catholics_images.csv`**
Quantitative survey data from 25 Catholic respondents addressing:
- Whether sacred images must be perfect to please God
- Whether respondents avoid reverence toward AI-generated images
- Response patterns categorized for comparative analysis

**Interview Data Files**
- `battery_of_questions.md` - Complete battery of interview questions with analytical categories
- `interviewee_1.md` through `interviewee_7.md` - Individual interview responses systematized for analysis
- Each interviewee file contains responses to all five questions with categorization

### Visual Materials

**Sankey Diagrams**
Two complementary flow visualizations:
1. **Flow of Algorithmization** - Traces transformation from divine sources → traditional art → digitalization → AI systems → digital outputs
2. **Degradation of Representation** - Maps contamination process from authentic sources → corrupted datasets → generic processing → critical errors → problematic outputs

These diagrams are available as standalone HTML files with interactive features.

## Methodological Approach

### "Between-Worlds" Method
Following Orsi (2005), the research distinguishes different "universes" within contemporary Catholicism, avoiding homogenization of "Catholic positions." Recognizes Catholics as operating within multiple, sometimes contradictory cosmologies.

### Circular Methodology
The research employed iterative returns to the field:
1. Initial netnographic observation in Catholic forums
2. Survey design based on forum discussions
3. Semi-structured interviews informed by survey patterns
4. Return to visual social media platforms
5. Semiotic analysis of AI-generated images
6. Final synthesis of findings

### Actor-Network Theory Framework
Drawing on Bruno Latour's ANT, the research treats all entities (human, divine, technological, material) as potential actants with agency in networks of meaning-making around sacred images.

## Key Research Questions

1. How do contemporary Catholics categorize and validate sacred art?
2. What role does "perfectibility" play in determining image adequacy for veneration?
3. How do algorithmic systems disrupt traditional chains of abduction that recognize divine agency?
4. What cosmologies (anthropocentric vs. demonological) shape Catholic responses to AI-generated religious images?
5. Can AI participate in "cooperation with grace" essential to sacred art production?

## Data Collection Context

- **Location**: Brasília, Brazil
- **Period**: 2024-2025
- **Primary Fields**: 
  - r/Catholic and r/Catholicism (Reddit)
  - Suscipe Domine Traditional Catholic Forum
  - Catholic university WhatsApp groups
  - Instagram (visual social media analysis)
- **Language**: Portuguese (English translations provided in documentation)
- **Ethics**: Informed consent obtained; pseudonyms used for privacy

## Usage Guidelines

### For Researchers
This repository serves as:
- Primary data source for studies on religion and technology
- Methodological reference for virtual ethnography in religious contexts
- Case study in Actor-Network Theory application
- Example of mixed-methods approach (qualitative + light quantitative)

### Important Considerations
- Data represents specific demographic: urban, educated, digitally-connected young adult Catholics in Brazil
- Not representative of global Catholic perspectives
- Cultural specificity of Brazilian Catholicism should be considered
- Generational factors in technology adoption are significant
- Self-selection bias present (participants from active Catholic communities)

## File Navigation

### Suggested Reading Order
1. `methods_used.md` - Understand research methodology
2. `methodology_flowchart.md` - Visualize research process
3. `actors.md` + `flow_actors.md` - Grasp theoretical framework
4. Survey data + interview materials - Examine empirical evidence
5. Sankey diagrams - Understand transformation and degradation processes

### Internal Linking
Many files contain wikilinks designed for use in Obsidian or similar knowledge management systems. These create a rhizomatic reading experience enabling non-linear exploration of concepts.

## Theoretical Framework

### Primary Theoretical Sources
- **Alfred Gell** - Art and Agency (abductive chains, index-prototype relationships)
- **Bruno Latour** - Actor-Network Theory (distributed agency, non-human actants)
- **Victor and Edith Turner** - Image and Pilgrimage (exegetical vs. operational meaning)
- **Gilbert Durand** - Symbolic Imagination (redundancy, transcendence)
- **Robert Orsi** - Between-Worlds methodology
- **Thomistic Philosophy** - Catholic doctrine on art and beauty

### Key Concepts
- **Algoimages**: Images generated or transformed by automated systems
- **Abductive Chains**: Cognitive processes allowing recognition of divine agency through material images
- **Cosmological Negotiations**: How Catholics reconcile traditional beliefs with technological innovations
- **Perfectibility**: Tension between doctrinal positions and aesthetic expectations
- **Cooperation with Grace**: Traditional requirement that sacred art emerges from artist's spiritual practice

## Research Findings Summary

The research demonstrates that Catholic resistance to AI-generated sacred images emerges from multiple overlapping dimensions:

1. **Disruption of Abductive Chains**: Inability to trace divine agency through opaque algorithmic processes
2. **Fragmented Art Categories**: Definition of art by qualities (beauty, perfection, order) that AI doesn't consistently guarantee
3. **Cosmological Tensions**: Conflict between anthropocentric (AI as neutral tool) and demonological (AI as potential preternatural vector) worldviews
4. **Category Inadequacy**: Algorithms cannot participate in "cooperation with grace" essential to sacred art production
5. **Semiotic Failures**: AI-generated images contain iconographic errors, theological inconsistencies, and loss of traditional symbolic redundancy

## Applications

- Academic research on religion and technology
- Digital humanities projects
- Theological studies on sacred art
- AI ethics in religious contexts
- Cultural studies of contemporary Catholicism
- Visual culture and semiotics research
