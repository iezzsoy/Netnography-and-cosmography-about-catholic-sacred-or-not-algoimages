# Netnography-and-cosmography-about-catholic-sacred-or-not-algoimages

## Overview

This repository/vault gathers the **empirical, methodological, and analytical materials** of a qualitative research project on **sacred art, sacrality, technology, and artificial intelligence within contemporary Catholicism**, with special emphasis on symbolic, aesthetic, and doctrinal reception of images (including AI-generated images).

The collection is organized for use in **Obsidian**, with strong internal interlinking (wikilinks), allowing non-linear navigation and layered reading (methods → data → analyses → conclusions).

## File Structure

### 1. `Bateria de perguntas.md`

Contains the **main set of questions** used in the semi-structured interviews.

* Total of **5 questions**, divided into two blocks:

  * Art and sacrality (Q1–Q3)
  * Technology and AI (Q4–Q5)
* Each question includes **prior analytical categories**, later used for response classification.
* The file also references the **individual interviewee profiles**.

**Role in the project:** conceptual and analytical instrument guiding both data collection and qualitative categorization.

---

### 2. `Dados entrevistas.md`

File dedicated to the **systematization of interview data**.

* Reorganizes the question set into a **structured, quasi-database format**.
* Includes:

  * Identification of interviewees
  * Direct correspondence between questions and answers
  * Categorization of responses according to predefined analytical criteria

**Role in the project:** intermediary layer between raw data and interpretive analysis, enabling comparative reading and trend identification.

### 3. `Métodos utilizados.md`

Central document for the **methodological foundation** of the research.

Includes:

* Detailed description of the methods employed:

  * Netnography (virtual ethnography)
  * Documentary analysis
  * Comparative analysis
  * Semi-structured interviews
  * Survey methodology
  * Visual semiotic analysis
  * Circular observer method
* Justification of field selection
* Explanation of iterative returns to the field
* Theoretical grounding for categories such as *universes*, *pluriverse*, symbolic reception, and the distinction between art, technique, and sacrality

**Role in the project:** ensures scientific rigor, methodological transparency, and interpretive coherence for the final article.

### 4. `survey_catholics_images.csv`

Dataset from the **complementary quantitative survey**.

* Sample size: **25 respondents**
* Core questions:

  1. Whether sacred images must be perfect in order to please God
  2. Whether respondents avoid reverence toward AI-generated sacred images
* Responses categorized into combined patterns (yes/yes, yes/no, etc.)

**Role in the project:** provides a light statistical background to contrast with qualitative and semiotic analyses.

## Obsidian Navigation Logic

Suggested reading order:

1. `Métodos utilizados.md` → understanding the **how** and **why**
2. `Bateria de perguntas.md` → comprehension of the **analytical instrument**
3. `Dados entrevistas.md` → examination of the **organized data**
4. Analysis files, diagrams, and conclusions (referenced via internal links)

The vault was designed to support:

* Rhizomatic reading
* Constant return to empirical material
* Progressive conceptual refinement

---

## Final Notes

* Interviewees are treated **not as isolated opinion holders**, but as expressions of **distinct symbolic universes** within a contemporary Catholic pluriverse.
* The material should not be read as opinion polling, but as **analysis of reception, form, and meaning**.
* The use of AI tools (ChatGPT, ArtPics, Freepik) is **deliberately experimental**, intended to expose iconographic limits, visual heresies, and symbolic displacements.

---

## Recommended Use

* Academic research
* Article or chapter writing
* Symbolic and aesthetic analysis
* Studies on religion, technology, and modernity
