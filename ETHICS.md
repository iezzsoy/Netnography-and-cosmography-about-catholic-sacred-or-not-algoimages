# RESEARCH ETHICS  
**Cosmological Negotiations on Algorithmic Icons in Catholic Universes**

---

## 1. Context and Ethical Justification  
This research explores **the negotiation of sacredness in religious images generated by artificial intelligence** among Brazilian Catholics. It is a sensitive topic that involves:  
- Religious beliefs and personal devotion  
- Perceptions of technology and spirituality  
- Representations of the sacred and the transcendent  
- Tensions between tradition and technological innovation  

The investigation combines mixed methods: netnography, surveys, semi-structured interviews, and semiotic analysis of AI-generated images, with a special focus on the relationship between sacred art, agency, and the mediation of the divine.

## 2. Ethical Principles Applied  

### 2.1 **Free and Informed Consent**  
- All research participants were clearly and accessibly informed about the study’s objectives, the nature of the questions, and data usage.  
- In the survey, the question *“Can I contact you later if I need to?”* ensured explicit consent for future contact.  
- In interviews, verbal consent was obtained after a detailed explanation of the research and assurance of anonymity.

### 2.2 **Treatment of Public Forum Data**  
- The online forums analyzed (*Suscipe Domine Traditional Catholic Forum* and *r/Catholic*) are **public digital spaces**, whose contents are accessible to any user without restriction.  
- The usernames cited (such as “Heinrich,” “KroKre,” “Batglide,” “StandFirmThen”) **do not correspond to real identities**, being pseudonyms deliberately adopted by the users themselves.  
- The collected notes and discussions **were not edited, censored, or decontextualized**; they were transcribed with fidelity and analyzed with academic rigor.  
- The exposure of this content does not constitute an ethical violation, since:  
  - The authors voluntarily published it in an open environment;  
  - Pseudonyms protect their civil identities;  
  - The analysis valued the depth and quality of the debates, bringing them into the scientific field in a respectful and engaged manner.

### 2.3 **Respect for Beliefs and Religious Sensitivity**  
- Questions were formulated **not to challenge, ridicule, or disrespect** participants’ beliefs.  
- Semiotic analysis of AI-generated images was conducted with academic rigor, without a derogatory tone toward sacred representations.  
- Iconographic and theological errors in AI images were treated as **research data**, not as grounds for mockery or value judgments.

### 2.4 **Protection Against Emotional or Spiritual Harm**  
- Discussions about “demonic influence” or “preternatural agency” of AI were treated with anthropological seriousness, without reinforcing fears or stigmas.  
- Participants who expressed discomfort with AI images had their opinions recorded without pressure to justify them.  
- The research neither encouraged the use of AI for devotional purposes nor discouraged traditional practices—it remained neutral and observational.

### 2.5 **Methodological Transparency**  
- Methods were described in detail in the work (netnography, survey, interviews, semiotic analysis, Sankey diagrams).  
- Analytical categories (e.g., objective vs. subjective responses about art) were defined a priori and applied consistently.  
- AI images used in semiotic analysis were generated with public *prompts* and reproduced strictly for academic purposes.

## 3. Sensitive Aspects and Their Handling  

### 3.1 **AI-Generated Sacred Images**  
- Images of Jesus, Mary, and saints generated by AI were analyzed as **cultural artifacts**, not as objects of devotion or blasphemy.  
- Iconographic errors (e.g., incorrect colors, swapped symbols, distorted anatomy) were documented as **representation problems**, not spiritual failures.  
- The “degradation of sacred representation” was treated as a **technical and semiotic process**, not as a moral judgment on AI or its users.

### 3.2 **Supernatural Cosmologies and Demonological Views**  
- Reports associating AI with demonic influences were recorded as **valid ethnographic data**, reflecting native cosmologies.  
- The research neither endorsed nor refuted such views—it remained within the anthropological description of **how Catholics understand technology**.  
- Terms such as “preternatural,” “demonic,” or “spiritual agency” were used in the sense they appear in the field, without normalization or pathologization.

### 3.3 **Dissonance Between Doctrine and Practice**  
- The observation that believers demand “technical perfection” even when Catholic doctrine does not require it was treated as **empirical data**, not as criticism of orthodoxy or participants’ piety.  
- The tension between doctrinal knowledge and practical criteria for veneration was analyzed through the lenses of Turner, Gell, and Latour, without value judgments about theological “correctness.”

## 4. Data Protection and Legal Compliance  

### 4.1 **Storage and Access**  
- Raw data (survey responses, interview transcripts, forum screenshots) were stored in a secure environment, with access restricted to the researcher.  
- Personal data (names, contacts) were stored separately from responses and will be discarded after the research concludes.

### 4.2 **Compliance with Brazilian Data Protection Law (LGPD)**  
- The research followed the principles of the **Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD)**, ensuring specific purpose, adequacy, and security in data processing.  
- Participants were informed of their rights to access, correct, and delete data.

### 4.3 **Academic and Non-Commercial Use**  
- Data are used exclusively for academic purposes—publication of articles, conference presentations, completion of undergraduate thesis (TCC).  
- No data will be commercialized, shared with third parties without consent, or used for promotional purposes.

## 5. Reflexivity and Researcher Positioning  

### 5.1 **Anthropological Neutrality**  
- The researcher adopted the stance of a **participant observer**, seeking to understand native logics without imposing external views.  
- At no point was it asserted that AI “should” or “should not” be used for devotional purposes—the research describes, does not prescribe.

### 5.2 **Acknowledgment of Limitations**  
- The sample (25 in the survey, 7 interviews) is limited and does not represent the entirety of Brazilian Catholics.  
- The research focused on urban young Catholics and online forum participants, which may bias results toward more connected and reflective groups.

### 5.3 **Commitment to Scientific Rigor and Human Respect**  
- The analysis aimed to be **ethically engaged and methodologically rigorous**, balancing thick description with ethical sensitivity.  
- The researcher committed to **not exposing, embarrassing, or harming** participants at any stage of the research.

## 6. Guidelines for Publication and Dissemination  

- Results will be disseminated in academic formats (articles, undergraduate thesis, presentations), with accessible yet specialized language.  
- Direct quotations from participants will be reviewed to avoid indirect identification.  
- AI-generated images will be reproduced for illustrative purposes, always accompanied by critical analysis and contextualization.  
- If interested, a summary of findings will be made available to participants upon request.
